Customer Churn Analysis

This project provides a comprehensive analysis of customer churn behavior, exploring various factors such as service features, demographic data, and payment methods.
Utilizing insightful visualizations like count plots and stacked bar charts, the analysis reveals key patterns that can guide retention strategies.
Key findings include higher churn rates among senior citizens (55% vs. 30% for non-seniors), and customers using electronic check as a payment method (45% churn).
Services like Tech Support and Streaming Services also play significant roles in customer retention, with those lacking Tech Support showing a 50% churn rate. 
The overall churn rate of 26% indicates that targeted retention strategies are crucial, especially for senior citizens, electronic check users, and customers without essential services.
Recommendations from this analysis include tailoring retention efforts to at-risk groups and improving service offerings to reduce churn.
